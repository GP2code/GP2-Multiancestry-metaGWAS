### Quick Description: 
Performing a multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis using the summary statistics of the largest Parkinson's disease GWASs in European, Asian, and Latin American ancestries followed by fine-mapping the loci using MR-MEGA and PESCA. To combine ancestrally diverse association studies to increase power to detect novel PD-associated loci and improve fine-mapping resolution.

### Background:
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are a popular, cost-effective method to identify and test common genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotype-phenotype associations. GWASs have been useful to begin explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits and better understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Genetic variations found significantly in individuals with the disease compared to those without, those variants are then "associated" with disease.

Traditionally, due to lack of data collection in other ancestries, GWASs have been conducted in European populations to focus on limiting population stratification effects on studies. Multi-ancestry studies aim to leverage the natural differences in linkage disequilibrium across diverse populations, the knowledge known about one population, and assess if those variants replicate across populations populations while increasing statistical power. 

Additionally, multi-ancestry GWASs for the identification of SNPs associated with disease risk in mixed populations, allow for fine-mapping of functional variants, and prioritization of candidate genes.
 
Studies involved:
- European: **Identification of novel risk loci, causal insights, and heritable risk for Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.** *Nalls et al. 2019*
- Latin American: **LARGE‚ÄêPD: Examining the genetics of Parkinson's disease in Latin America.** *Zabetian and Mata; 2017*
- Asian: **Identification of Risk Loci for Parkinson Disease in Asians and Comparison of Risk Between Asians and Europeans: A Genome-Wide Association Study.** *Foo et al. 2020*

Process:
1. Multi-ancestry meta-analysis
2. Fine-mapping 
3. Functional mapping and annotation
4. Estimation of proportions of population-specific and shared causal variants



### Results:
**Link to Manuscript:** Under preparation

We identified in total 67 independent genome-wide significant loci including 2 novel loci (MTF2, PPP6R2). 15 putative causal SNPs were identified in 4 known loci
